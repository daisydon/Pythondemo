#In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, 
#both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. 
#What I have done is to build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios. 
#There are two files which contains code I have writen:

#search.py: algorithm for search
#searchAgent.py: problems definition and heuristics
